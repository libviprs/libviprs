# Changelog

All notable changes to libviprs are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-25

The headline change in 0.3.0 is `EngineBuilder`: the five free-function entry
points (`generate_pyramid`, `generate_pyramid_observed`,
`generate_pyramid_streaming`, `generate_pyramid_mapreduce`,
`generate_pyramid_mapreduce_auto`) and `generate_pyramid_resumable` are gone,
replaced by a single typed builder that routes to the monolithic, streaming,
or map-reduce engines. `FsSink` also moved to a 2-arg constructor plus a
`with_format` builder.

See [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) for before/after snippets for the most
common 0.2.0 call sites.

### Added

- `EngineBuilder` and `EngineKind` (`Auto`, `Monolithic`, `Streaming`,
  `MapReduce`) — single typed entry point that routes to every engine.
- `EngineSource` enum and `IntoEngineSource` trait so `EngineBuilder::new`
  accepts either `&Raster` or any `T: StripSource` directly.
- `extensions` module and `EngineBuilder::with_extension::<T>(value)` typed
  extension bag.
- `EngineError::IncompatibleSource` for engines that cannot accept the source
  kind they were handed (e.g. `Monolithic` with a strip source).
- `ResumePolicy` (factories `overwrite()`, `resume()`, `verify()`, plus
  `with_checkpoint_every` / `with_checkpoint_root`) wired through the builder
  via `with_resume(...)`. Honored by every engine — Monolithic, Streaming, and
  MapReduce.
- `RetryPolicy::fail_fast()` and `RetryPolicy::with_max(n)` convenience
  constructors; `FailurePolicy` and `RetryPolicy` are first-class on the
  builder via `with_retry(...)` / `with_failure_policy(...)`.
- `DedupeStrategy` exposed on the builder via `with_dedupe(...)` and on
  `FsSink` via `.with_dedupe(...)`.
- Full lifecycle `EngineEvent` variants: `SourceLoadStarted`, `SourceLoaded`,
  `PlanCreated`, `LevelStarted`, `LevelCompleted`, `StripRendered`,
  `BatchStarted`, `BatchCompleted`, `Finished`, `PipelineComplete` (alongside
  the existing `TileCompleted`).
- `EngineObserver` is threaded through every engine via
  `EngineBuilder::with_observer(...)` and `with_observer_arc(...)`.
- `PackfileSink::builder(path)` + `PackfileSinkBuilder` fluent form
  (`.plan(...).format(...).tile_format(...).build()`); `SinkError::MissingField`
  variant surfaced when a required field is omitted.
- `FsSink::with_format(TileFormat)` builder method.
- `stream_verify` module — verify pyramid output against the source.
- `pixel::PixelFormat` is now public and re-exported at the crate root (used by
  `EngineEvent::SourceLoaded`).
- Blanket `impl TileSink for &T` so `&FsSink` and friends work where a
  `TileSink` is required.
- `pdfium-static` cargo feature (pulls in `pdfium` plus
  `pdfium-render/static`) for statically linking libpdfium.

### Changed (breaking)

- `FsSink::new` is now 2-arg: `FsSink::new(dir, plan)`. Format is set via
  `.with_format(TileFormat)`; default remains `TileFormat::Png`.
- `EngineBuilder::with_config(EngineConfig)` is the supported way to override
  the full `EngineConfig`; the old per-call `&EngineConfig` argument is no
  longer accepted by free functions because the free functions no longer
  exist.

### Removed (breaking)

- Free functions `generate_pyramid`, `generate_pyramid_observed`,
  `generate_pyramid_streaming`, `generate_pyramid_mapreduce`,
  `generate_pyramid_mapreduce_auto` — use `EngineBuilder` with the
  appropriate `EngineKind`.
- `generate_pyramid_resumable` — absorbed into
  `EngineBuilder::with_resume(ResumePolicy::resume())`. The internal helper
  is now `pub(crate)`.
- `FsSink::new_with_format(...)` — kept as a deprecated alias of
  `FsSink::new(...).with_format(...)`; will be removed in a future release.

### Fixed

- `pdf_info` honors `/Rotate` when computing page dimensions.
- `PdfiumStripSource` now renders the full page once, then slices strips,
  fixing inconsistencies at strip boundaries on rotated pages.
- `RetryPolicy` backoff rounds nanoseconds to avoid floating-point truncation.
- Phase-3 filesystem tests are gated under Miri via
  `#[cfg_attr(miri, ignore)]`.

### Internal

- Build patches `pdfium-render` against the `libviprs/pdfium-render` fork.
- Version bumped to 0.3.0.

## [0.2.0] — 2025

Phase-3 hardening: manifest v1, sinks, resume, retry, dedupe, tracing.
